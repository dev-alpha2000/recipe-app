Overview
This project is a Recipe App built using React. The app allows users to search for recipes, view detailed instructions, and save their favorite recipes. It fetches data from a recipe API (such as Edamam, Spoonacular, etc.) and displays the recipe information in an easy-to-read format.

Features
Search Recipes: Users can search for recipes by keyword (e.g., ingredient, dish name).
Recipe Details: View detailed information about each recipe, including ingredients, instructions, and nutritional facts.
Favorite Recipes: Option to save favorite recipes locally in the browser.
Responsive Design: The app is fully responsive and works well on both desktop and mobile devices.
